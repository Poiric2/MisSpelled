  - 'The world can be destroyed and rebuilt but only if known is the foil to make
    it wilt.  To burn life till naught is left but earth, To shock the soil till it
    has fused to solid metal, To strike the metal till it yields to the fire of its
    wielder. To drown the fire till it returns to the air, To chill the air till the
    water inside falls to earth, And to finally dry the water till the life inside
    is laid bare.  But stay thy hand, the initiate alchemist  For as the world can
    yield to the will of the adept Against the fool it will retaliate.  To douse life
    will bring about nil but strife, Frozen earth is the prison to your mirth, Those
    who dry metal prove pathetically brittle, Heating fire brings forth hellish ire,
    From electrified air a storm will tare, And those who strike strike the water
    the tides shall slaughter. '
