  - "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The
    humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most
    of the jokes will go over a typical viewer\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Rick\u2019s
    nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal
    philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans
    understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate
    the depths of these jokes, to realise that they\u2019re not just funny- they say
    something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly
    ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour
    in Rick\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201CWubba Lubba Dub Dub,\u201D which
    itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
    I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons
    scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself
    on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them."
  - "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I\u2019ll
    have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I\u2019ve been
    involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed
    kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I\u2019m the top sniper in the entire
    US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you
    the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this
    Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit
    to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret
    network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better
    prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing
    you call your life. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime,
    and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that\u2019s just with my bare
    hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access
    to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its
    full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little
    shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201Cclever\u201D
    comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking
    tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the
    price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in
    it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo."
  - My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother
    said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to
    stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly
    was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer.
    It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please
    don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed.
    At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense
    of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.
