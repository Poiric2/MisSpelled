  - '*Sticky note in the book* On an expedition into numerous winding and dazzling
    caverns, I came upon a strange artifact. Its numerous sides are riddled with runes
    I have not studied yet - and for some reason a few of its sides are glowing.   I
    will consult my texts at home, I believe I have seen a few of the runes in my
    Grimoire. The Grimoire itself is impossible to read, but since I found Ye Olde
    Runick Charte at Ace Hardware it has made life a bit easier.   Must-haves in a
    laboratory (Kinda like a note that she taped into the book as a reminder for things
    she always needs) '
  - "Two Cauldrons - The first for chilling and soaking ingredients, and the second
    for burning ingredients.  One Tesla Coil - For shocking ingredients.  One Mortar
    & Pestle - A means by which to grind ingredients.  One Potion Table - An area
    for combining ingredients.    *On sticky note (or something) in book*  Consult
    the Ingredient Catalog to ensure proper brewing - if met with trouble, take a
    look at The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Wizardry."
